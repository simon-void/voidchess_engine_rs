VoidchessEngineRS
=================

The web version of this chess engine can be played [here](https://simon-void.github.io/voidchess_engine_rs/).

The project started as a Rust re-implementation of the chess engine of my older desktop chess program
[VoidChess](http://simon-void.github.io/voidchess) which is written in Kotlin.



## Build Wasm Module

by executing the bash scripts `wasm-pack-and-copy-over_dev` or `wasm-pack-and-copy-over_release`.
This will update the voidchess_engine_wasm-module in the docs/engine folder.
